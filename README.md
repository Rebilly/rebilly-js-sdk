# Rebilly JS SDK Library (Pre-Release)
The Rebilly JS SDK library allows you to consume the Rebilly API using either Node or the browser.

> The library is not production ready yet. Version 1.0.0 will be the first stable release.

### PCI Compliance Note
If you need to handle raw payment card data, you should use the [Rebilly Token library](https://my.rebilly.com/api/jsdoc/) to generate tokens for your server-side logic.

### Rebilly API Spec
The library is a semantic representation of the [Rebilly API spec](https://rebilly.github.io/RebillyAPI/). A secondary [experimental API spec for reports](https://rebilly.github.io/RebillyReportsAPI/) is also available.

## Installation
Install the package with:
```
npm install rebilly-js-sdk --save
```

## Usage
To create an instance, you need to provide your secret API key that is available in Rebilly in the [Developer > API Keys](https://app.rebilly.com/api-keys) menu.

> Every resource method returns a chainable Promise.

ES7 usage example:
```js
import RebillyAPI from 'rebilly-js-sdk';

const api = RebillyAPI({apiKey: 'secret-api-key'});

try {
    const transactions = await api.transactions.getAll();
    transactions.items.forEach(transaction => {
        //transaction.fields
    });
} catch (err) {
    console.error(err.name);
}
```

ES5 usage example:
```js
var RebillyAPI = require('rebilly-js-sdk').default;
var api = RebillyAPI({apiKey: 'secret-api-key'});

api.transactions.getAll()
    .then(function(transactions) {
        transactions.items.forEach(function(transaction) {
            //transaction.fields
        });
    })
    .catch(function(err) {
        console.error(err.name);
    });
```

### Error Handling
The SDK returns several different types of errors based on the HTTP response, ranging from 401 to 422. They are exposed and can be imported:
```js
import {RebillyErrors} from 'rebilly-js-sdk';
```

#### Error Types
| Type | Status Code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `RebillyRequestError` | `-` | Generic error when no response is available. |
| `RebillyTimeoutError` | `-` | The request timed out. |
| `RebillyCanceledError` | `-` | The request was canceled before being completed. |
| `RebillyForbiddenError` | `401` | Indicates an invalid API key or expired session token. |
| `RebillyNotFoundError` | `404` | Requested resource was not found. |
| `RebillyMethodNotAllowedError` | `405` | Request method not allowed on this resource. |
| `RebillyConflictError` | `409` | Requested operation triggered a conflict. |
| `RebillyValidationError` | `422` | The request payload triggered a validation error (see error details). |

### Configuration
The library authentication can be provided by the `apiKey` or a session token (JWT). All instantiation parameters are *optional*.

Example:
```js
const api = RebillyAPI({apiKey: 'secret-api-key', sandbox: true, timeout: 10000});
```

#### Configuration Options
| Option | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `apiKey` | `string` | Your secret API key. To be used only for server-side integration. See [Developer > API Keys](https://app.rebilly.com/api-keys). |
| `sandbox` | `boolean` | Flag used to enable sandbox mode for the instance. This allows you to run requests without processing real transactions on your account. Defaults to `false`. |
| `timeout` | `integer` | Define the timeout in milliseconds for API requests. Defaults to `6000`.|
| `version` | `string` | Define the version of the API to use. Defaults to `v2.1`. This configuration does not apply to `RebillyExperimentalAPI`. |

### Collections and Members
All resource calls except CSV or PDF downloads return either Members or Collections. Members are returned by all methods other than `getAll`, which returns a Collection. A collection contains a list of members. Both types are **immutable** (frozen) objects that can return a JSON representation of their member properties.

Example:
```js
const collection = await api.transactions.getAll();
collection.items.forEach(member => {
    //member.fields
});
```

#### Collection
A collection is a list of member entities, e.g. a list of customers or a list of transactions. Each collection exposes standard properties:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `items<Member>` | An array of member entities. Each one represents a single resource entity. |
| `limit` | An integer defining the amount of members requested at once. |
| `offset` | A zero based integer defining the starting position for the requested members. |
| `total` | An integer defining the total amount of members that exist regardless of the requested limit. |
| `response` | The original response stripped down to the status code, status text and headers. `{status, statusText, headers}` |
| `getJSON()` | Returns a JSON representation of the items that can be mutated. |

#### Member
A member is a single resource entity, e.g. a customer or a transaction. Each member exposes standard properties:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `fields` | A list of fields within the member entity. For example the customer's `ID`. |
| `response` | The original response stripped down to the status code, status text and headers. `{status, statusText, headers}` |
| `getJSON()` | Returns a JSON representation of the member fields that can be mutated. |

## Rebilly Experimental API
The Rebilly Experimental Reports API is available as a secondary API within the library. Unlike the main API, it can introduce backward incompatible changes to the API specification. It is used mainly for reporting and requests with heavy computational loads like dashboard statistics.

```js
import RebillyAPI, {RebillyExperimentalAPI} from 'rebilly-js-sdk';

const experimentalAPI = RebillyExperimentalAPI({apiKey: 'secret-api-key', sandbox: true, timeout: 10000});
```
