# RebillyAPI
Standard Rebilly API client that will be backward-compatible within each major release of the library.

**API Spec**

See the [Rebilly API spec](https://rebilly.github.io/RebillyAPI/) for full details on the different API calls exposed within this client.

## Importing
The `RebillyAPI` factory is the default export of the `rebilly-js-sdk` package.

```js
import RebillyAPI from 'rebilly-js-sdk';
```

## Configuration
All client API configuration parameters are optional. However a secret API key can only be provided at instantiation.

!!! info "API Environments"
    By default an instance is always generated in the **Live** environment. The **Sandbox** mode is only recommended while developing your integration. 

##### Parameters
```js
const api = RebillyAPI({apiKey: 'secret-api-key', sandbox: true, timeout: 10000});
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `apiKey` | string | `null` | Your secret API key. To be used only for Node integrations. See [Developer > API Keys](https://app.rebilly.com/api-keys). |
| `sandbox` | boolean | `false` | Flag used to enable sandbox mode for the instance. This allows you to run requests without processing real transactions on your account. |
| `timeout` | number | `6000` | Define the timeout in milliseconds for API requests. |
| `version` | string | `v2.1` | Define the version of the API to use. Defaults to v2.1. |

## Public Methods
The API client exposes different configuration and utility methods you can use to customize your instance.

### setSessionToken
<div class="method"><code><strong>setSessionToken</strong>(<span class="prop">token</span>)</code></div>

To retrieve a session token, first initialize the API client without an API key and use the sign in resource to login the user to Rebilly. The token will be available in the response fields.

> See [api.account.signIn][goto-account-signin]

**Example**

```js
// instantiate an unauthorized API client
const api = RebillyAPI();

// build the sign in payload
const payload = {data: {email, password, expiredTime}};

// the 'signIn' method does not require API authorization to complete
const response = await api.account.signIn(payload);

// an authorization using the response fields
api.setSessionToken(response.fields.token);

// this request will be authorized using the token
const customers = await api.customers.getAll();

!!! tip "Promises"
    All resource methods return chainable Promises.

**Example**
```js
//get the latest 100 customers starting from the 100th one
api.customers.getAll({offset: 100});
```

Payment tokens are used to reduce the scope of PCI DSS compliance. A payment token can be made using a different authentication scheme , which allows you to create a payment token directly from the browser, bypassing the need to send sensitive cardholder info to your servers. We recommend using this with our Rebilly.js library, which helps you wire a form into this API resource and create payment tokens.

!!! info ""
    See the [**Profile resource**][29] for detailed method information.

### Sessions
`:::js api.sessions`

Create and list 3DS entries. 3D Secure is a way to authenticate and protect transactions. Typically, it's only possible to protect the initial transaction in a subscription with 3D Secure.

The merchant chooses whether or not to use 3D secure, and this is usually done via an iframe on the merchant's site. This allows the merchant to shift liability from themselves to the issuing bank in some cases.  3D Secure requires cardholder interaction to be completed.

!!! info ""
    See the [**Three D Secure resource**][34] for detailed method information.
